v0.1 12Sept2014 -- First commit

Description:
This project provides code that can be used to solve the problems listed at https://projecteuler.net/problems.

To run:
- Copy the relevant module locally
- import the relevant module ("problem1, problem2 etc...") into your python class like so
	import problem1
- run the script with module's run method like so:
	problem1.run(<relevant arguements>)

To test:
- Locally copy all the files in this project
- run the following: python test.py

Important notes:
- Adhering with the intentions of the site https://projecteuler.net/, the following programs are NOT meant to publish the solutions of the problems. 
- Instead, they publish the programmatic steps I have used to get to the solutions of the problems.
- On running the modules with the right input arguments, you will be able to see the solutions of the problems and be able to complete the Euler Problems Challenge.
- However, I do NOT recommend doing this unless you have tried to solve the problems yourselves first. The code here meant as a source of hints for people who are stuck.
- Further, keeping with the intentions of the site, I request that you do not publish the solutions you recieve from running these programs. Please let others have the fun of figuring it out themselves.
- I do recommend running the test cases. They solve the problems for different input values.

Finally, my solutions are far from perfect, so feel free to use and modify as you please. Just make sure not to ruin the fun for others.

Thanks and happy mathing!
Cheers
